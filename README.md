# Chess Project

A Chess Game with a Swing GUI. The game uses a [minimax](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/game-theory/Minimax.html) AI opponent to calculate optimal moves based on the number of points available when taking pieces or threatening the king.

This was one of my first significant projects, completed during high school. It holds a special place as a milestone in my development journey, showcasing just how much I’ve grown since then. The codebase, however, is a prime example of early programming pitfalls—it’s a tangle of nested if statements, tightly coupled objects, inefficient logic, and a complete lack of tests! Maintaining or expanding it would be nearly impossible, but it serves as a humbling reminder of where I started.
